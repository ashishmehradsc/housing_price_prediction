# ðŸŽ¯ Objective: Predict the housing prices in the region
_Real estate company would like a real estate prediction mechanism. This valuation will  depends on multiple factors. i.e. location, type of building, macro-economy to name a few. Knowing the potential direction and strength of prices is very helpful for the construction companies and also real estate sales companies to align their investments and sales strategy._


## ðŸ“‰  Data: 

The data available is describing different aspects of properties in the Bay area. Name of the fields and their respective explanation is given below - 

| Field | Exaplanation |
| ------ | ------ |
| **Longitude**  | A measure of how far west a house is; a higher value is farther west navigation | - 
| **Latitude**  | A measure of how far north a house is; a higher value is farther north |
| **housing_median_age**  |  Median age of a house within a block; a lower number is a newer building |
| **total_rooms**  | Total number of rooms in the block |
| **total_bedrooms**  | Total number of bedrooms in a block |
| **population**  | Total number of people residing in a block |
| **households**  | Total number of households, a group of people residing within a home unit, for a block |
| **median_income**  | Median income for households within a block of houses (measured in tens of thousands of US Dollars) |
| **median_house_value**  | Median house value for households within a block (in USD) |
| **ocean_proximity**  | House has a ocean in proximity or not |

## ðŸ”Ž Approach:
- Data preparation was done importing the given data.
- Feature completeness anad accuracy checks were performed. 
- Data preprocessing was done based on the checks performed:
        > Duplicates and missing data was treated.
        - Obvious unecessary columns were removed.
        - Outliers were removed.
- Exploratory data analysis confirmed no major red flags.
- Categorical columns were encoded using one hot encoding.
- Data was split into features and the label (aka target).
- Trained the linearregression algorithm on the dataset.

## ðŸ’»  Dependencies:

**IDE:**
- Jupyter Notebook (alternatively Google Colab can be used)

**Python Libraries:**
```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

```

## ðŸ”Ž Results:

||  Metric  |  Score|
|----| ------ | ------ |
|Training | R^2 | 0.6122729171374928 |
|Test | R^2 | 0.6244442222072821 |
